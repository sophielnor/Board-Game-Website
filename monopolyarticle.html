                In Monopoly, players take turns rolling the dice, traveling around a circular board, buying, selling and trading real estate, as they collect and pay rent, fines, and taxes with the aim of bankrupting your opponents.
              <br> Monopoly is a game notorious for taking a long time time play. This, by itself, wouldn't make it a terrible game but Monopoly also suffers from being boring and offering the losing players no hope of getting back into the game.
              Monopoly is boring several reasons: because all of the properties provide the same ratio of cost to rent and a property someone else needs is useful for trading, they are all worth buying, hence there aren't a lot of decisions for players to make for most of the game while they're just travelling around the board buying everything they land on.
               The only real choices players make in the game are bidding for properties in the rare case that they do go to auction and trading properties, which doesn't happen until the later part of the game and isn't even all that interesting.
               Come the latter part of the game, players will usually be able to tell who is going to win through what properties they were able to pick up and the players who weren't able to pick up many properties have to keep playing, sometimes for hours, as not much happens meanwhile they still have no real decisions to make and no hope of coming back into the game.
               <br><br>
               Most games will allow players who are losing to come back into the game through some balancing mechanism, like getting better boosters while you're in last place in Mario Kart, or offer an element of luck or randomness so that they can turn it all around, like the triple word scores, high scoring letters and bonus for getting all of your letters out in scrabble.
               Not Monopoly. No, in Monopoly, the losing players just keep landing on other people's properties, losing whatever meager money and properties they had in the process and get more demoralised every round for hours until they finally bankrupt or the other players have mercy on them and let them surrender.
              And speaking of losing, once a player is eliminated they have to wait around for hours while other people continue to play.
              <br><br>
              There are thousands of Monopoly varients, probably more than for any other game in existence but whether you're playing Barbieopoly, Hello Kitty Monopoly, or Star Trekopoly, they all play basically all the same.
              I think the only reason Monopoly is still sold is unknowing parents who don't know what to get their child for Christmas thinking 'my child likes Minecraft, this Monopoly is Minecraft themed, they're sure to love it!', not realising that the child would much rather play just play Minecraft than Minecraft Monopoly, the child will feel obligated to play one game of Minecraft Monopoly with their parents to mask their disappointment and after that one game
               (that is, if everyone has the willpower to get through an entire game of it) and then the child will go back to playing Minecraft and Minecraft Monopoly will collect dust in an attic for years until finally being donated to a charity shop where it can be bought by another poor, unsuspecting gift-giver.
<br><br>
               In conclusion, Monopoly is a horrible, horrible game. It will ruin your Christmas and destroy your family. It should be made illegal and all copies of it should be burnt and their ashes sent into the farthest reaches of outer space.
               In case you are a cruel person looking for the perfect gift to give to somoneone you hate, here is a link to the <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_us/" class=text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-700">publisher's website</a>.
               Just make absolutely certain that you aren't within a 10 mile radius of the game when the poor unfortunate soul you bought it for comes to play it.
